# procedural-generation-dungeon

Open source code to my procedural generation game inspired by Enter the gungeon and other games

To do for Christmas:

- [ ] Build algorithm itself
- [ ] Sort out very basic combat system and gate system to win game

After Christmas:

- [ ] Evolve the combat system to be better
- [ ] Implement things like the seed system
- [ ] Speedrun timer in game
- [ ] Improve graphics (I know they will be terrible beforehand)
